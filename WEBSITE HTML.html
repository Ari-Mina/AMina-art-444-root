        <h2>F.A.Q.</h2>
        <h3>when will you be graduating sdsu?</h3>
        <p>I intended to graduate this May 2025!</p>
        <h3>what do you have planned after graduating?</h3>
        <p>After graduating I am looking for jobs within my field such as applying to a multimedia firm in San Diego called Doctor Multimedia. I also intend to explore my options outside of my field such as applying to the Sony video game department.  </p>
        <h3>what was your favorite class?</h3>
        <p>My favorite class while attending SDSU was an expressive typography class I took as an elective. My Professor Yomar Agusto was a very expressive person and very passionate about the art of typography. I enjoyed learning calligraphy and being able to craft my own font from paper to screen. </p>
        <h3>what are you most proud of?</h3>
        <p>What I am most proud of is pushing through my degree despite many set backs. During my fall 2024 semester I encountered a professor who blatantly told me I would fail the class the second week into the semester. Having an anxiety disorder, and multiple mental health issues, I wanted to drop out many times with that instance being a very big deterrent to any motivation I held at the time. Luckily I was able to push through the darkness and hope to finish school by this year. </p>
